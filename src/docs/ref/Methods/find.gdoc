h1. find

h2. Purpose

The @find@ method allows you to search for objects in the DIT as defined in @ldapService.dit@. See the [Configuration|guide:configuration] section on details of how @ldapService.dit@ is defined.

Currently, @Where@ is implemented as a dynamic finder. I hope to be able to add the @By@ dynamic finder in a future release (e.g., @find\*BySnAndDepartmentNumber@).

h2. Examples

These examples assume the following was defined in @ldapService.dit@:

{code}
ldapService.dit = [
    'ou=people,dc=socialidm,dc=com':[
        'singular':'person',
        'plural':'people',
        'rdnAttribute':'uid'
    ]
]
{code}

In the above configuration, we defined that the 'singular' version of this branch as 'person', and the 'plural' version as 'people'.

To understand how these work, see the examples, below:

{code}
// Find one 'person', i.e., person is 'singular'
ldapService.findPersonWhere('uid':'12345')

// Even if you use an attribute that would potentially return more than one,
// you are only going to get one result with the 'singular' version!
ldapService.findPersonWhere('sn':'rockwell')

// Find 'people', i.e., people is the 'plural' version
ldapService.findPeopleWhere('departmentNumber':'12345', 'manager':'0128653')

// find also allows you to specify a simple string as a filter
ldapService.findPeopleWhere('(|(sn=rockwell)(sn=smith))')

// You can not use a wildcard * or ? in a simple string filter because it will
// get escaped, so you have to use an UnboundID LDAP SDK Filter if you want
// a more complicated filter
def filter = <an UnboundID LDAP SDK Filter>
ldapService.findPeopleWhere(filter)
{code}

LdapService @AND@s together the arguments to the @find@ method. If you want @OR@, or more complicated filters, like ones with wildcards, then you will have to construct an UnboundID LDAP SDK filter and supply that as the argument to @find@.

h2. Description

Unlike GORM, with LdapService you do not define concrete classes which are then used to find objects. For instance, with GORM, you might have a Person domain class, and then you would find people like this:

{code}
// Returns zero or at most one
Person.findWhere('lastName':'rockwell')

// Returns zero or more than one
Person.findAllWhere('lastName':'rockwell')
{code}

With LdapService, you use the singular and plural versions of the LDAP branches (as defined in @ldapService.dit@) to determine if you want one or more results.

{code}
// Returns zero or at most one
ldapService.findPersonWhere('lastName':'rockwell')

// Returns zero or more than one
ldapService.findPeopleWhere('lastName':'rockwell')
{code}

The table below compares the GORM and LdapService find differences.

{table}
*Number of Results* | *GORM* | *LdapService*
0 or 1 | @findWhere@ | @findPersonWhere@
0 or more | @findAllWhere@ | @findPeopleWhere@
{table}

In these examples, 'person' and 'people' are used only because they were defined in @ldapService.dit@. If you define other names in @ldapService.dit@, then you would have to use those names.
