h2. Overview

DirectoryService is a [Grails|http://grails.org/] [plugin|http://grails.org/plugins/] that allows you to interact with a v3-compliant LDAP server with minimal effort. It is built on top of the [UnboundID|http://www.unboundid.com/] [LDAP SDK|http://www.unboundid.com/products/ldap-sdk/].

DirectoryService is inspired by [GORM|http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/GORM.html], but since this is LDAP, we really can only go as far as inspired, because there is no "R" (relational) in LDAP. Unlike a database, LDAP does not really have a structure (well, there is the DIT, but that is about it), so it does not seem reasonable or necessary to make concrete classes to represent LDAP objects. As you read more about this plugin, and start to use it, you will realize why concrete classes are unnecessary.

Furthermore, you can use [Command Objects|http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#commandObjects] for your logic for your directory objects, i.e., you don't need to put them into a class that is specific to a tree in LDAP. (At least that is how I feel about this now, and Command Objects are just as powerful as Domain Objects.)

As mentioned above, DirectoryService is built on top of the UnboundID LDAP SDK, and therefore, that SDK is exposed through this plugin. However, it is best if you try to use the methods provided by the plugin as much as possible, as the SDK API may change. That is, we try to encapsulate the basic functionality that you need, but if you really need something you can go under the covers. Also, feel free to open an [Enhancement Issue on GitHub|https://github.com/lr/directory-service/issues].

{note}
This plugin assumes you have working knowledge of LDAP. If you need to get familiar with LDAP, please see the [Resources|guide:resources] section.
